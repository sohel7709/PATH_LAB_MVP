Deployment Instructions for LabNexus Application

1. Backend Environment Variables:
- PORT: The port number on which the backend server will run (e.g., 5001).
- MONGODB_URI: The MongoDB connection string for your database.
- CORS_ORIGIN: Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS, e.g.:
  https://labnexus.in,https://www.labnexus.in

2. Backend Deployment:
- The backend server reads the above environment variables.
- Ensure the environment variables are set in your production environment.
- Start the backend server with the command:
  node src/app.js
  or using your process manager (pm2, systemd, etc.)

3. Frontend Deployment:
- The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend during development.
- For production, if frontend and backend are deployed separately:
  - Set the environment variable VITE_API_URL in the frontend environment to the backend API URL, e.g.:
    VITE_API_URL=https://api.labnexus.in
  - Use this variable in your frontend code to make API requests.

4. Domain Configuration:
- Ensure your DNS points to the correct servers for frontend and backend.
- SSL certificates should be configured for https://labnexus.in and https://www.labnexus.in.

5. Additional Notes:
- The backend CORS configuration uses the CORS_ORIGIN environment variable to allow requests from your domain.
- The frontend does not require changes to vite.config.js if served from the root domain.
- Monitor logs and server health regularly.

For any issues, refer to the project documentation or contact the development team.
